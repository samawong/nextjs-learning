            "Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more. And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the barcode reader breaks and it's Publisher's Clearing House day."
